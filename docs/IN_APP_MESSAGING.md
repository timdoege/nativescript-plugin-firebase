## Want to see a demo?
Check out the (code of the) [Vue demo](demo-vue)!

## Enabling In-App Messaging
To add this feature to your project, either:

* Remove `firebase.nativescript.json` from the root of the project and run `npm i`, or
* Edit that file and add `"in_app_messaging": true`.

In both cases, remove the `/platforms` folder afterwards so the required native library will be added upon the next build. 

## API
There's nothing you have to do code-wise if you only want to display messages.
If you want to capture a 'button clicked' event however, read on.

### `onMessageClicked`

```typescript
import { inappmessaging } from "nativescript-plugin-firebase/inappmessaging";

inappmessaging.onMessageClicked(message => {
  console.log("Clicked a button for Campaign: " + message.campaignName);
});
```

### `onMessageImpression`
You can also get notified if a message is being shown to a user:

```typescript
import { inappmessaging } from "nativescript-plugin-firebase/inappmessaging";

inappmessaging.onMessageImpression(message => {
  console.log("A message belonging to this campaign is being shown: " + message.campaignName);
});
```

### `triggerEvent`
Trigger in-app messages programmatically.

Firebase In-App Messaging by default allows you to trigger in-app messages with Google Analytics for Firebase events, with no additional integration. You can also manually trigger events programmatically with the Firebase In-App Messaging SDKâ€™s programmatic triggers.

In the In-App Messaging campaign composer, create a new campaign or select an existing campaign, and in the Scheduling step of the composer workflow, note the event ID of a newly-created or existing messaging event. Once noted, instrument your app to trigger the event by its ID.

```typescript
import { inappmessaging } from "nativescript-plugin-firebase/inappmessaging";

const eventName = "myEvent";
inappmessaging.triggerEvent(eventName);
```
